# Project Motivation

## Audience and Purpose

I truly believe that LLM (ChatGPT) is one of the most advanced technologies humanity has ever created

Its functionality is very wide, starting from copyrighting and ending with code generation

A few examples of what you can do with ChatGPT:
 - Generating manuals, white papers, and documentation.
 - Language learning: Assisting with grammar, vocabulary, and practice conversations.
 - Study aid: Providing summaries, notes, and flashcards.
 - Email drafting: Composing professional and personal emails.

The list goes on and on, so potentially any person despite his age, area of expertise, or occupation can find it useful

## Platforms

Telegram is widely used with mobile devices, browsers, and desktop applications.

So it's also true for the Bot. It can be used on any device with Telegram running.

## Why not just use ChatGPT?

### Pros
The project started as a thing only for Personal Usage

Basically ChatGPT subscription (with GPT-4o and no strict limits) costs 20$ per month

Using ChatGPT with API you pay as you go, practically I pay only 1$ per month with this approach

Besides economic reasons, I prefer the Telegram interface and I have more control over the way I interact with the AI

More than that with Telegram you can share your OpenAI access with family and friends, also in group chats, which is fun

### Cons

Unlike ChatGPT, The Bot doesn't work with "context" meaning it doesn't remember the previous messages

Honestly, for me, it is not even a con, because I never need it and prefer not to have it, this is also a key to making API usage cheaper

Another thing is that the Bot requires some infrastructure to run, but since it requires almost non compute resources and can even smoothly run on any local computer, this is not a big deal

## Future plans

As you can see currently all billing functionality is basically fake

I will implement the billing functionality in the near future, and I also have some other ideas too
