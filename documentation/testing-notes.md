As you can see currently there is no much different functionality implemented

Project is in the early stage of development, I personally would love to get unit tests from Yandex Workshop team, 

which would help to move forward developing new features

I am fully open to any suggestions from you guys, so please feel free to share your thoughts

If you find the project "too small" for now to work on it, I would be happy to come back later with more code to test
