As you can see currently there is little functionality implemented

The project is in the early stage of development, I personally would love to get unit tests from the Yandex Workshop team, 

which would help to move forward with developing new features

I am fully open to any suggestions from you guys, so please feel free to share your thoughts

If you find the project "too small" for now to work on, I would be happy to come back later with more code to test
